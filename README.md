# National Parks Webpage - Capstone Project

## Overview

This is the capstone project for my web development course, where the goal was to create a webpage for users to explore information about national parks. The project incorporates two search methods: searching for parks by state location and searching by park type. Additionally, there is a dropdown feature allowing users to view mountains in 48 states.
## Features

- **Search by State Location:** Users can search for national parks based on their state location. The webpage provides information about each park in the selected state.

- **Search by Park Type:** Users can explore national parks based on their types, allowing them to discover parks with specific characteristics or attractions.

- **Dropdown for Mountain Information:** A dropdown menu provides users with the ability to select a state and view information about mountains in that state. This feature is designed to cater to a variety of aventure enthusiasts.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of the project were to:

- Implement search functionality using functions, arrays, and loops to allow users to find parks based on state location and park type.

- Create a dynamic dropdown menu that allows users to select a state and view information about mountains widely popular nationwide.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **index.html:** The main HTML files containing the structure of the webpages.

- **styles.css:** The stylesheets for styling the webpages.

- **script.js:** The JavaScript files containing functions, arrays, and loops to handle the webpages' dynamic features.

## How to Run the Project
